# Dog-breed-classification

This is a capstone project of data scientist nanodegree program offered by Udacity.The link of my blog post for this project is here. https://medium.com/@sidharth.ku178/dog-breed-classification-with-cnn-16faeabd6255

### Libraries used

 1. numpy
 
 2. sklearn
 
 3. keras
 
 4. glob
 
 5. matplotlib
 
 6. cv2
 
 7. tqdm
 

### Overview

The main goal of this project is to classify the image of dogs according to their breed.You can deploy an app by fulfilling the requirments of capstone project if you follow this jupyter notebook for creating a classifier and you can also make a blog post by following this notebook.There are nearly 120 dog breeds are present in the database.Our gole is to identify the breed of dogs by giving an image.
Here i made the first step to develope an algorithm and made a web application. After finish of the project, our code will take an image as input. It will identify the breed of the dog if the input image is a dog's image.If we will give a image of human as input then it will identify that it is a human.


### Implementation

There are some steps that how we create this model.

Step 1: Import the Datasets

Step 2: Detect the Humans

Step 3: Detect Dogs

Step 4: Create a CNN to Classify the Dog Breeds from Scratch

Step 5: Use a CNN to Classify the Dog Breeds by using Transfer Learning

Step 6: Create a CNN to the Classify Dog Breeds by using Transfer Learning

Step 7: Write your Algorithm

Step 8: Test Your Algorithm
